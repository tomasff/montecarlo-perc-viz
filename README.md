## Monte Carlo Simulation Visualizer
This small web application can be used to visualize a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates
the percolation threshold of an n-by-n grid.

You can find the WIP demo [here](https://tomff.com/montecarlo-perc-viz/).

### What is percolation
Percolation is an abstract process that can be used to model different physical phenomena.
It can be used to model, for example, what fraction of materials need to be metallic so that a system is an electric conductor.

### Inspiration and credits
This visualisation is heavily inspired by the [Percolation assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php) developed by
Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne for the [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/) course.

The implementation of the weighted quick union find is based on the one given in the course
but rewritten in JavaScript.
